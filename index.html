            <h2>The Life of a Scientific Pioneer</h2>
            <p>Marie Skłodowska Curie (1867-1934) was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who
                conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first
                person to win Nobel Prizes in multiple scientific fields, and the first woman to become a professor at
                the University of Paris.</p>

            <h2>Her Remarkable Achievements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1891</strong> - Moved to Paris to study physics and mathematics at the University of Paris
                </li>
                <li><strong>1893</strong> - Earned a master's degree in physics</li>
                <li><strong>1894</strong> - Earned a master's degree in mathematics</li>
                <li><strong>1895</strong> - Married physicist Pierre Curie</li>
                <li><strong>1898</strong> - Discovered the elements polonium and radium with her husband Pierre</li>
                <li><strong>1903</strong> - Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics jointly with Pierre Curie and Henri
                    Becquerel for their work on radiation</li>
                <li><strong>1906</strong> - Became the first female professor at the University of Paris after Pierre's
                    death</li>
                <li><strong>1911</strong> - Awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of the elements
                    polonium and radium</li>
                <li><strong>1914</strong> - Helped establish the Curie Institutes in Paris and Warsaw</li>
                <li><strong>1934</strong> - Died from aplastic anemia, believed to be caused by exposure to radiation
                </li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so
                    that we may fear less."</p>
                <p class="quote-author">— Marie Curie</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h2>A Legacy of Scientific Excellence</h2>
            <p>Marie Curie's contributions to science have been immeasurable. Her discovery of polonium and radium led
                to significant advances in the treatment of cancer. The development of X-rays during World War I saved
                countless lives. Her dedication to science, despite facing significant gender discrimination, paved the
                way for women in STEM fields.</p>

            <p>Her legacy lives on through the Curie Institute, which continues to be a major cancer research center and
                hospital. The element curium was named in honor of Marie and Pierre Curie. Her papers from the 1890s are
                still considered too dangerous to handle due to their radioactivity and are kept in lead-lined boxes.
